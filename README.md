# Block-Breaker
Developed a simple block breaker game, including moving blocks. 

Language: Java 

Game Play: Users can press the right and left arrow keys in order to control a paddle to bounce the ball across the screen. The aim of the game is to break all the blocks (stationary and moving) appearing at the top of the screen using the ball. If the ball hits the sides, top of the screen or paddle, it will simply bounce back. However, once the ball hits the bottom of the screen, meaning that it missed the paddle, the user loses the game. 

Cool Features: Utilizes a randomly generated cool-toned color palette to vary the color of the blocks. Includes a primary set of stationary blocks for the user to clear, which is then followed by three moving blocks that warp across the screen.
